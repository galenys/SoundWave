# SoundWave
Hi, this is a music visualiser I built in p5.js using Perlin noise. You can add your own songs to it and see them visualised.

## How to use
- Just open the index.html file and it should start straight away!

## Requirements
- I would recommend using Chrome, but any web browser should work.
- The p5 and p5 sound libraries are packaged with the repository, so you don't need an Internet connection to use this.

## How to change the song
- Save a .mp3 file in the repo.
- Go to soundwave.js.
- Change `song = song = loadSound("song2.mp3")`
to load whatever song you want.
- Reload the page and it should work.

The song takes a while to load, which is something I'm trying to fix, but in the interim please be patient.
